I am a Master's (MSc) student in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (EEIT) at [ETHZ](https://ethz.ch/en). While trying to broaden my knowledge in numerous domains (and not only STEM), I'm particularly interested by Digital Signal Processing and Machine Learning. 

My rather uncommon studiying path, which begun in a vocational school ([ETML](https://etml.ch/)), allowed me to start by gaining valuable practical experience and develop logical/intuitive capacities in the broad electronics field, as well as the FH Electrical Engineer title in an engineering school ([HEIA-FR](https://heia-fr.ch/)). On the other hand, my studies at ETHZ allow me to expand my theoretical knowledge, while consolidating and expanding my skillset.

My free time is shared among experimenting different ideas, being an ambitious [athlete](https://www.strava.com/athletes/d_raimundo) and improving my soft skills.
